# Problem Set 2 – Loops

This problem set explores **loops, iteration, and string manipulation** in Python. The exercises reinforce control flow through repetition, validation, and transformation of user input.

## Problems

### 1. camelCase (`camel.py`)
- Converts variable names from **camelCase** to **snake_case**.  
- Prompts the user for a camelCase variable and outputs the equivalent snake_case variable.  
- Example: `preferredFirstName` → `preferred_first_name`.

---

### 2. Coke Machine (`coke.py`)
- Simulates a **Coke vending machine** where each bottle costs 50 cents.  
- Accepts only coins of 25¢, 10¢, or 5¢.  
- Continuously prompts until at least 50¢ is inserted, then outputs the correct change owed.

### 3. Just setting up my twttr (`twttr.py`)
- Prompts the user for text and **removes all vowels** (A, E, I, O, U) from the input, case-insensitively.  
- Example: `Twitter` → `twttr`.

---

### 4. Vanity Plates (`plates.py`)
- Validates custom license plates according to Massachusetts vanity plate rules:  
  - Must start with at least **two letters**.  
  - Length: **2–6 characters**.  
  - Numbers allowed **only at the end** (cannot start with `0`).  
  - No spaces, punctuation, or symbols allowed.  
- Outputs **`Valid`** or **`Invalid`** accordingly.  

---

### 5. Nutrition Facts (`nutrition.py`)
- Prompts the user for the name of a fruit (case-insensitive).  
- Outputs the **calorie count** for one portion, per FDA nutrition data.  
- Ignores invalid inputs or non-listed items.  

---

## Skills Practiced
- Implementing and controlling **loops** (`while`, `for`).  
- Input validation and condition checking.  
- String transformation and filtering.  
- Function design with return values and modular structure.
