# CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python – Problem Sets

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python**.  
Each problem set is organized into its own folder, with a dedicated `README.md` explaining the problems, approach, and files included.

## Problem Sets

### [Problem Set 0 – Functions, Variables](pset0/README.md)
Covers basics of functions, conditionals, and variables.  

### [Problem Set 1 – Conditionals](pset1/README.md)
Introduces branching, comparisons, and user input handling.  

### [Problem Set 2 – Loops](pset2/README.md)
Focuses on iteration, string manipulation, and loops.  

### [Problem Set 3 – Exceptions](pset3/README.md)
Teaches exception handling, error checking, and robustness.  

### [Problem Set 4 – Libraries](pset4/README.md)
Applies external libraries to solve real-world tasks.  

### [Problem Set 5 – Unit Tests](pset5/README.md)
Introduces **test-driven development (TDD)** using `pytest`.  

### Problem Set 6 – File I/O *(in progress)*
Will cover reading and writing files in Python.  

### Problem Set 7 – Regular Expressions *(in progress)*
Explores pattern matching using regex.  

### Problem Set 8 – Object-Oriented Programming *(in progress)*
Introduces classes and object-oriented design in Python.  

### Problem Set 9 – Final Project *(in progress)*
Capstone project applying all course concepts.
