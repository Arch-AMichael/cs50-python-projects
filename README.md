# CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python – Problem Sets

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from **CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python**.  
Each problem set is organized into its own folder, with a dedicated `README.md` explaining the problems, approach, and files included.

## Problem Sets

- [Problem Set 0 – Functions, Variables](./Problem%20Set%200)  
  Covers basics of functions, conditionals, and variables.

- [Problem Set 1 – Conditionals](./Problem%20Set%201)  
  Introduces branching, comparisons, and user input handling.

- [Problem Set 2 – Loops](./Problem%20Set%202)  
  Focuses on iteration, string manipulation, and loops.

- [Problem Set 3 – Exceptions](./Problem%20Set%203)  
  Teaches exception handling, error checking, and robustness.

- [Problem Set 4 – Libraries](./Problem%20Set%204)  
  Applies external libraries to solve real-world tasks.

- [Problem Set 5 – Unit Tests](./Problem%20Set%205)  
  Introduces test-driven development (TDD) using `pytest`.

- [Problem Set 6 – File I/O](./Problem%20Set%206)  
  Works with reading and writing files, handling structured data.

- [Problem Set 7 – Regular Expressions](./Problem%20Set%207)  
  Uses regex for pattern matching and text processing.

- [Problem Set 8 – Object-Oriented Programming](./Problem%20Set%208)  
  Implements classes, objects, and OOP design principles.

- [Problem Set 9 – Final Project](./Problem%20Set%209)  
  Capstone project applying concepts from the entire course.
